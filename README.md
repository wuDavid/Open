###Open
Open is a webapp for those that want to design or re-design webpages, 
but have little experience using HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

####Implementation
Open's HTML is inside the site's main HTML file, and all JavaScript variables are 
either the name of the element (like `div` or `p`) or its id, class, or anchors.
